# NSF-grant-visualization

The National Science Foundation (NSF) are the funding source for approximately 25 percent of
all federally supported basic research conducted by America's colleges and universities. Our
team is conducting an analysis on the NSF Award data shown over the years and visualize the
data to conclude awards analysis granted, to do that we collect/export our XML formatted data
directly from the provided link (https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/download.jsp) We parsed
the data using Python (pandas data frame) and extracted the file as CSV to start our analysis.
Then we used multiple software to demonstrate our findings such as (Tableau, PowerBI, and
Jupiter Notebook.)
Post our visualization we were able to analyze the spread of the awards are in the East coast,
West coast, and South of the United States, also showed the highest dollar amount of NSF grant
was given to Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Science, a total of $30 Billion. We also
analyzed the abstract and title of the NSF proposal using the Natural Language Processing (NLP)
technique. We identified that Machine Learning/Data analysis is the topic that has received the
most grant.
